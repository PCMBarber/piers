My ERD Diagram stayed the same throughout the project the many to many table relationship was fairly difficuly to code

![KANBAN board](Images/Card_GameTrello.png)

Most of my KANBAN Board has been fully realised in the web app, noreable exceptions are; a seperate cloud environment for the flask app and; Admin ability to delete cards. Noteable successes are; Admin panel requiring the inclusion of a user class system in the database and; Users accessing many deck lists.

![Testing Coverage](Images/Card_GameCoverage.png)

Testing could be drastically improved with Integration testing. This project will become a test base for me to practice tests on.

[CI Pipeline install file](.install)

My CI Pipeline includes an install file that makes jenkins set up much more streamlined.
